# IBM-dicoding
This is a project concerning image classification to fulfill the requirement of IBM-dicoding. I was given an opportunity by  IBM Indonesia New Collar &amp; Skill Accelerator Center as one of their scholarship awardee. In this project, I have to make a deep learning algorithm to employ image classification n rock-paper-scissor dataset.

This is the result that I obtained. I performed convolutional neural network with adam optimizer with adaptive learning rate.

I obtained accruacy of 98% (training set) and 97% (on validation set) with 3:2 split ratio.
